### Project Goals

- - -


The aim of this project was to build a site that allows users to easily sign, keep up with titbits and interact with others users who are free to share their thoughts.


### Agile
The Agile Tool was used to help to organize and prioritize the tasks using Project Boards on GitHub.
A Template for issues was created to speed up the process of adding User Stories to this project. In the repositorie, head over to the settings, then Set Up Templates on the Features. The Issue Template helps to add enough information to the card, so the Developer knoks what are the MVP Points to address.
![Issues template](documentation/images/set-up-template.png)

![Issues template](documentation/images/user-story-template.png)

A Sheet was created to help gathering details to place in each card. 

The MoSCow priorization and customized labels to user stories were used to priorize and implement the features.


* Must Have: guaranteed to be delivered (max 60% of stories)
* Should Have: adds significant value, but not vital (the rest ~20% of stories)
* Could Have: has small impact if left out (20% of stories)
* Won't Have: not a priority for this iteration

![Labels](documentation/images/labels.png)

The allocation the User Stories to Milestones helps in planning the Sprints.
7 Milestones were created.
![Milestones](documentation/images/milestones-1.png)
![Milestones](documentation/images/milestones-2.png)

The Kanban Board, as an agile project management tool, helped to visualize the tasks and limit the work in progress (WIP) by moving cards between the To do, In progress and Done columns.
![Kanban Board](documentation/images/network-board.png)

The Table View was used to sorted the issus according to labels, milestones or status.

##  Design
üìù
<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

### Colour Scheme

The design is quite simple to not disctract the users. The CSS variables were used to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.
The red color was used only on Delete Button to call attention.

| Color             | Hex                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Dark charcoal| ![#333](https://via.placeholder.com/10/333?text=+)  #333|
| Light blue | ![#d2dfef](https://via.placeholder.com/10/d2dfef?text=+)  #d2dfef|
| Blue | ![#89b1d6](https://via.placeholder.com/10/3b81c0?text=+)  #89b1d6 |
| Dark blue | ![#3b81c0](https://via.placeholder.com/10/3b81c0?text=+)  #3b81c0 |
| Rosa | ![#e95b95](https://via.placeholder.com/10/e95b95?text=+) #e95b95 |
| Red | ![#BB2D3B](https://via.placeholder.com/10/BB2D3B?text=+) #BB2D3B |



### Typography

The [Braah One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Braah+One?query=braa) was used for the Logo Titbit and header elements in memory of the orkut platform.

![Typography Braah One](documentation/images/braah-one.png)

The  [Roboto 300 light](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap) was used for the body text on the site. Roboto is a sans-serif font which allows it to be legible and is a great choice for accessibility.

![Typography Roboto](documentation/images/roboto.png)

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons/) icons were used throughout the site, such as the logo icon and social media icons in the footer.



### Imagery

* [Emojis](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md)
* Pictures from Error pages were dowloaded from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and edited at [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

###  Future Implementations 
üß† 

Besides the features were registered as Won't Have in the MoSCoW prioritization in the [User Stories](#user-stories), the future implementations I would like to:

* Add calendar to birth date.
* Apply paginator on Post Detail Page.
* Prepopulate the login fields after a user registers on the site and is redirected to the login page - this is good UX as we shouldn't expect a user to fill in the form with information we already have. 
* Business Profile.
* Advertisements.
* App for smartphones.
* Refactor the like and dislike code for front-end to avoid rendering.
* Events page.
* 

###  Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

The live deployment application can be found on [Heroku](https://titbit-network.herokuapp.com/).

### Deployment

###   Local Development
üè°

#### How to Fork

To fork the repository:

1. Log in (or sign up) to Github.

2. Go to the repository for this project, [Titbit](https://github.com/luandretta/network).

3. Click the Fork button in the top right corner.

#### How to Clone

To clone the repository:

1. Log in (or sign up) to GitHub.

2. Go to the repository for this project, [Titbit](https://github.com/luandretta/network).

3. Click on the code button, select whether you would like to clone with HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI and copy the link shown.

4. Open the terminal in your code editor and change the current working directory to the location you want to use for the cloned directory.

5. Type the following command in the terminal (after the git clone you will need to paste the link you copied in step 3 above):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/luandretta/network
    ```

6. Set up a virtual environment (this step is not required if you are using the Code Institute Template in GitPod as this will already be set up for you).

7. Install the packages from the requirements.txt file by running the following command in the Terminal:

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```


### ElephantSQL Database

This project uses [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for the PostgreSQL Database.

To obtain your own Postgres Database, sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:
- Click **Create New Instance** to start a new database.
- Provide a name (this is commonly the name of the project: tribe).
- Select the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan.
- You can leave the **Tags** blank.
- Select the **Region** and **Data Center** closest to you.
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.


### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.
- For *Primary interest*, you can choose *Programmable Media for image and video API*.
- Optional: *edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable*.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.


### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | insert your own Cloudinary API key here |
| `DATABASE_URL` | insert your own ElephantSQL database URL here |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | this can be any random secret key |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
```bash
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:
```bash
echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile
```
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: 
```bash
heroku login -i
```

- Set the remote for Heroku: 
```bash
heroku git:remote -a app_name #(replace *app_name* with your app name)
```

- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
```bash
git push heroku main
```
The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!


### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "insert your own Cloudinary API key here")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "insert your own ElephantSQL database URL here")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "this can be any random secret key")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Start the Django app: 
```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `‚åò+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations:
```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
```
- Migrate the data to the database:
```bash
python3 manage.py migrate
```
- Create a superuser:
```bash
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
- Run the Django app:
```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```
