### Agile
The Project Boards on GitHub was used to help to organize and prioritize the tasks.
The Kanban, as an agile project management tool, helped to visualize the tasks and limit the work in progress (WIP) by moving cards between the To do, In progress and Done columns.

The MoSCow priorization and labels to user stories were used to priorize and implement the features.

* Must Have: guaranteed to be delivered (max 60% of stories)
* Should Have: adds significant value, but not vital (the rest ~20% of stories)
* Could Have: has small impact if left out (20% of stories)
* Won't Have: not a priority for this iteration

## üìù Design

<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

### Colour Scheme

The design is quite simple to not disctract the users. The CSS variables were used to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.
The red color was used only on Delete Button to call attention.

| Color             | Hex                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Dark charcoal| ![#333](https://via.placeholder.com/10/333?text=+)  #333|
| Light blue | ![#d2dfef](https://via.placeholder.com/10/d2dfef?text=+)  #d2dfef|
| Blue | ![#89b1d6](https://via.placeholder.com/10/3b81c0?text=+)  #89b1d6 |
| Dark blue | ![#3b81c0](https://via.placeholder.com/10/3b81c0?text=+)  #3b81c0 |
| Rosa | ![#e95b95](https://via.placeholder.com/10/e95b95?text=+) #e95b95 |
| Red | ![#BB2D3B](https://via.placeholder.com/10/BB2D3B?text=+) #BB2D3B |



### Typography

The [Braah One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Braah+One?query=braa) was used for the Logo Titbit and header elements in memory of the orkut platform.

![Typography Braah One](documentation/images/braah-one.png)

The  [Roboto 300 light](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap) was used for the body text on the site. Roboto is a sans-serif font which allows it to be legible and is a great choice for accessibility.

![Typography Roboto](documentation/images/roboto.png)

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons/) icons were used throughout the site, such as the logo icon and social media icons in the footer.



### Imagery

* [Emojis](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md)
* Pictures from Error pages were dowloaded from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and edited at [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)



### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

#### Home Page (Landing Page)
The home page is the landing page that the user will access if he has not yet started a Titbit session, i.e. if the user is not logged in.

### üß† Future Implementations 

Besides the features were registered as Won't Have in the MoSCoW prioritization in the [User Stories](#user-stories), the future implementations I would like to:

* Add change password functionality to the profile section.
* Apply paginator on Post Detail Page.
* Prepopulate the login fields after a user registers on the site and is redirected to the login page - this is good UX as we shouldn't expect a user to fill in the form with information we already have. 
* Business Profile.
* Advertisements.
* App for smartphones.

### üó£Ô∏è Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

### üö® Error Handling 

- - - 

While researching the best way to handle errors in a Flask application using blueprints I came across the following [article](https://nrodrig1.medium.com/flask-blueprints-error-handling-and-config-file-example-d1a031070763). I really liked how this solution allowed me to create a blueprint to custom handle a number of different errors, rather than just creating a single 404 error page.
