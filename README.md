### Agile
The Project Boards on GitHub was used to help to organize and prioritize the tasks.
The Kanban, as an agile project management tool, helped to visualize the tasks and limit the work in progress (WIP) by moving cards between the To do, In progress and Done columns.

The MoSCow priorization and labels to user stories were used to priorize and implement the features.

* Must Have: guaranteed to be delivered (max 60% of stories)
* Should Have: adds significant value, but not vital (the rest ~20% of stories)
* Could Have: has small impact if left out (20% of stories)
* Won't Have: not a priority for this iteration

### Colour Scheme

### Typography

The [Braah One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Braah+One?query=braa) was used for the Logo Titbit in memory of the orkut platform.

![Typography Braah One](documentation/images/braah-one.png)

The  [Roboto 300 light](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap) was used for the body text on the site. Roboto is a sans-serif font which allows it to be legible and is a great choice for accessibility.

### Imagery

* [Emojis](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md)



### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using Balsamiq.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- - -

<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

The website is comprised of X pages which are extended from a base template.

* Home page
* Register page
* Login page
* Logout page
* Profile page
* Edit profile page
* Feed all posts
* Feed from following
* Post detail
* Edit post
* Delete post
* Error page

### Elements found on each page

* Favicon 

  ![Titbit favicon](documentation/favicon.png)

* Navbar - The Navbar is displayed on all pages of the website and allows users to navigate the site with ease. The navbar is comprised of a logo, the sites name, links to navigate the site and a search bar. The links on the navbar will vary depending on whether a user is logged into their account.

  **User logged in Navbar**

### üß† Future Implementations 

In future implementations I would like to:

* Add change and reset password functionality to the profile section.
* Give users the option to delete their account in the profile section.
* Allow admin to be able to delete or block users.
* Prepopulate the login fields after a user registers on the site and is redirected to the login page - this is good UX as we shouldn't expect a user to fill in the form with information we already have. 

### üó£Ô∏è Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

### üö® Error Handling 

- - - 

While researching the best way to handle errors in a Flask application using blueprints I came across the following [article](https://nrodrig1.medium.com/flask-blueprints-error-handling-and-config-file-example-d1a031070763). I really liked how this solution allowed me to create a blueprint to custom handle a number of different errors, rather than just creating a single 404 error page.
