## LIGHTHOUSE TESTING OUTCOMES

<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

The deployed project was tested using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. The results for each page are listed bellow.

Notes:

* **Best Practices**: Displays images with incorrect aspect ratio - this will happen due to the uploading of photos by the user.

* Some tests were made using DevTool with Google Chrome, but it was very slow and other tests were made with Microsoft Edge, where the language was German. (Leistung = Performance, Barrierefreiheit = Accessibility)

## CODE VALIDATION

<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

### HTML

The [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate all HTML files.
In order to properly validate the HTML pages with Jinja syntax, the steps are followed for each file:

- Navigate to the deployed application using Google Chrome,
- Right-click anywhere on the page, and select View Page Source.
- Copy the entire "compiled" code, without any Jinja syntax., and use the validate by input method.

The result for each page are listed bellow:

|Page |Screenshot | Notes  | 
|:---:|:----------------------:|---|
| Home (Landing) |  Second test: ![HTML Validation - Home](documentation/images/v-html-home.png) |First test: **Warning**: The type attribute is unnecessary for JavaScript resources. - Removed from script.|

## AUTOMATED TESTING

<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

The Django's Built-in Unit Testing Framework was used to test the application functionality on the project without errors.
To perform the test the following step was used:
- In the terminal type the command:

```bash
python3 manage.py test
```
