## LIGHTHOUSE TESTING OUTCOMES

The deployed project was tested using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. The results for each page are listed bellow.

**Best Practices**: Displays images with incorrect aspect ratio - this will happen due to the uploading of photos by the user.

Some tests were made using DevTool with Google Chrome, but it was very slow and other tests were made with Microsoft Edge, where the language was German. (Leistung = Performance, Barrierefreiheit = Accessibility)

## CODE VALIDATION

### HTML

The [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate all HTML files.
In order to properly validate the HTML pages with Jinja syntax, the steps are followed for each file:

- Navigate to the deployed application using Google Chrome,
- Right-click anywhere on the page, and select View Page Source.
- Copy the entire "compiled" code, without any Jinja syntax., and use the validate by input method.

The result for each page are listed bellow:

- Home (Landing)

First test:
**Warning**: The type attribute is unnecessary for JavaScript resources. - Removed from script.

Second test:
